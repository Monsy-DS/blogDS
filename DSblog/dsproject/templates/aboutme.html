<p>And something about me. So...<br>Hello, my name is Petr and I'm from Prague - capital city of Czech Republic. You probably heard about us as a nation which is drinking more beers than any other nation. We drink beers so much that I found this information in a Harvard's presentation for CS109! <br>You can also heard about Czech Republic as a country which recently change its official name to Czechia. But the beer thing is more important <br><br>
But I wanted to talk about me. I studied at CTU in Prague, faculty of mechanical engineering department of process engineering and finished my studies in last day of August 2019 with master degree! In fact, I had to negotiate for an August date for my finals because faculty changed date to a september when I should have been on my vacation. Later that year I started as trained monkey in some technology services company, which was boring. In 2020 before covid started in Czechia I had changed my job and started to work as a safety engineer for a train maker. However cool that might sound it's just a simple math with a lot of paperwork.<br> I always liked coding but never have the courage... untill May of 2020 when my friend told me all cool things about ML, ANN and I started to dig more about all this awesome staff. I started with decision tree, random forest and jump quickly to perceptron, ANN, CNN (not the telly) and RNN. And half year later here we are. I created this web with trained modules. You can try it yourself how got they works (and also web for architecture studio - <a href="https://www.tdarchitecture.cz">check it here</a> Feedback send it to my email adres <span id="mail">mail@mail.mail</span>).<br>
But basically that't it. I could of course talk more about my life or show my CV here. But let save some time and don't do it!</p>
